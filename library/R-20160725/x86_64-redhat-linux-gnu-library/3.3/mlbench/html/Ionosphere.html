<h2>Johns Hopkins University Ionosphere database</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This radar data was collected by a system in Goose Bay, Labrador.  This
system consists of a phased array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a
total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts.  See the paper
for more details.  The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere.
&quot;good&quot; radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure 
in the ionosphere.  &quot;bad&quot; returns are those that do not; their signals pass
through the ionosphere.  
</p>
<p>Received signals were processed using an autocorrelation function whose
arguments are the time of a pulse and the pulse number.  There were 17
pulse numbers for the Goose Bay system.  Instances in this databse are
described by 2 attributes per pulse number, corresponding to the complex
values returned by the function resulting from the complex electromagnetic
signal. See cited below for more details.</p>

<p>They investigated using backprop and the perceptron training algorithm
on this database.  Using the first 200 instances for training, which
were carefully split almost 50% positive and 50% negative, they found
that a &quot;linear&quot; perceptron attained 90.7%, a &quot;non-linear&quot; perceptron
attained 92%, and backprop an average of over 96% accuracy on the 
remaining 150 test instances, consisting of 123 &quot;good&quot; and only 24 &quot;bad&quot;
instances.  (There was a counting error or some mistake somewhere; there
are a total of 351 rather than 350 instances in this domain.) Accuracy
on &quot;good&quot; instances was much higher than for &quot;bad&quot; instances.  Backprop
was tested with several different numbers of hidden units (in [0,15])
and incremental results were also reported (corresponding to how well
the different variants of backprop did after a periodic number of 
epochs).

<p>David Aha (aha@ics.uci.edu) briefly investigated this database.
He found that nearest neighbor attains an accuracy of 92.1%, that
Ross Quinlan's C4 algorithm attains 94.0% (no windowing), and that
IB3 (Aha \&amp; Kibler, IJCAI-1989) attained 96.7% (parameter settings:
70% and 80% for acceptance and dropping respectively).
