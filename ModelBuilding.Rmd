## Introduction
This code is built using the online github documentation of the caret package of Max Kuhn, [The caret Package](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html). Also the book [Applied predictive modeling by Max Kuhn and Kjel Johnson, 2013](http://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/dp/1461468485/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z) was used. [Previous studies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211675315000482) also used the same the same approache.

Here we use the caret package to built machine learning models to create a solar irradiance model. As input we use satellite data and ground based observations. We found that there is a small sinus yearly trend in the differences between the two products. Therefore also the day of the year is included as an additional explanatory variable for the differences between the two products. 

## Loading library
```{r}
library(data.table)
library(lubridate)
library(mgcv)
library(adehabitat)
library(automap)
library(caret)
library(doParallel)
library(kernlab)
library(reshape)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(SDMTools)
pro=CRS("+init=epsg:28992")
```

## Comparing the 2 products
To compare the satellite data with the point measurements the R function over is used. The data was stored in the file "sat_over_obs.csv". Using the data.table package and mgcv package we made a summary of the results. We find that the differences between the two products are small. There is a yearly pattern in the data: during winter months the satellite derived products has slightly higher values (max around 3W/m2) while in summer the opposit is true. 
```{r}
obs.df<-fread("Rdata/sat_over_obs.csv")
names(obs.df)<-c("IT_DATETIME","DS_CODE","Q","x","y","SAT","DIFF")
obs.df$IT_DATETIME<-as.Date(obs.df$IT_DATETIME)
obs.df$day<-yday(obs.df$IT_DATETIME)
obs.df$month<-month(obs.df$IT_DATETIME)

setkey(obs.df, day)

# summary_by_stationday <-data.obs[, mean(DIFF), by = .(year = year(IT_DATETIME),day=day,DS_CODE)]
summary_by_year_day <- obs.df[, mean(DIFF), by = .(year = year(IT_DATETIME), day)]
summary_by_year_month <- obs.df[, mean(DIFF), by = .(year = year(IT_DATETIME), month)]


#fitting routines
fit1 <- gam(V1 ~ s(year) + s(day, bs = "cc"), data = summary_by_year_day)
plot(fit1)

fit2 <- gam(V1 ~ s(year) + s(month, bs = "cc"), data = summary_by_year_month)
plot(fit2)
```

## Parallel cluster
The caret models allow parallel computations. In the trainControl function it states: allowParallel=TRUE. So, therefore we only need to make a cluster with the doParallel packages using 2 lines of code. 
```{r}
cl<-makeCluster(6)
registerDoParallel(cl)
```

## Building Machine Learning Algorithms

### Train control 
As we run in parallel and we want the results to be fully reproducable we have to set seeds in a different way. Also included in the traincontrol is the 10 fold cross validation, which is repeated 3 times. The data is also split with the createFolds option. Next, the tuning length of the model is set to 10. The final thing to set before we run the models is the tuneGrid parameters, which differ for each model (some models don't have tuning parameters). The nice thing is: you can specify a range of options. Note that you can get an error if your seeds are not compatible with your number of options (See [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21029019/parallel-execution-of-train-in-caret-fails-with-function-not-found)).

```{r}
set.seed(123)
seeds <- vector(mode = "list", length = 11)#length is = (n_repeats*nresampling)+1
for(i in 1:30) seeds[[i]]<- sample.int(n=1000, 30) #(30 is the number of tuning parameter, mtry for rf, here equal to ncol(iris)-2)
seeds[[31]]<-sample.int(1000, 1)
#control list
control<-trainControl(method="repeatedcv",repeats=3,index=createFolds(obs.df$Q),seeds=seeds) 
length<-10 #for the tuneLength of the models

sigmaRangeReduced<-sigest(as.matrix(obs.df$Q))[1]
# svmRadialRGridReduced<-expand.grid(.sigma=sigmaRangeReduced,.C=2^(seq(-4,4)))
# svmLinearRGridReduced<-expand.grid(C=2^(seq(-4,4)))
ctreeGridReduced<-expand.grid(mincriterion=seq(from=0.1,to=0.5,by=0.1))
knnGridReduced<-expand.grid(.k=3:15)
gbmGridReduced<-expand.grid(.shrinkage=c(0.1),.n.trees=3:5,.interaction.depth=4:6,.n.minobsinnode=3:5)
earthGridReduced <- data.frame(.degree = 1, .nprune = (2:4)*2)
fuzzyGridReduced <- expand.grid(num.labels=4,max.iter=4) #num.labels=3:10,max.iter=4:6
```

### Train models
As we saw in the first section there is a relation between the ground based observations and the satellite derived irradiance product. This relation also depends on the day of the year. Therefore we use the following formula to built the ML models: Q~SAT+day. During the preprocessing of the data is centered, scaled an transformed (using a BoxCox transformation). In case of more variables also a PCA analysis should be included. Some of the models are slow and take a long processing time, therefore some of the models are commented. Other models (such as svmLinear and svmRadial) exceed the critical memory of 2GB, and are therefore also commented. 

The best way of saving your models is by using the saveRDS command. This compressed data format can be read into R very fast, compared to the older commands in R you're also able to provide your loaded data with a name (thus not only the name you used to save the data). The stored models will be used to predict radiation for a larger area where no measurements are available. 

One should note that not the "normal" train function is used but caret::train. The addition of caret:: alows to predict spatial data. For spatial predictions we then use a line like: raster::predict(model=final.model,object=satellite.grid)

### The Results
The caret package provides some easy to use commands for summarizing your results. With resamples we list all the models and are able to plot them with bwplot. Also, model difference can be seen with one line of code. 
```{r}
results<-resamples(list(lm=m1.lm,
                        glm=m2.glm,
                        #gaussprLinear=m3.gaussprLinear,
                        #svmRadial=m4.svmRadial,
                        #svmLinear=m5.svmLinear,
                        #treebag=m6.treebag,
                        cubist=m7.cubist,
                        #ctreer=m8.ctree,
                        knn=m9.knn,
                        earth=m10.earth,
                        gbm=m11.gbm,
                        fuzzy=m12.fuzzy))
summary(results)
bwplot(results,scales=list(relation="free"),xlim=list(c(0,90),c(0,1)))
modelDifferences<-diff(results)
print(modelDifferences)
