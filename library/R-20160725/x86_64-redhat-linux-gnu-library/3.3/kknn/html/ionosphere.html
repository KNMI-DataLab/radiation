<h2>Johns Hopkins University Ionosphere Database</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This radar data was collected by a system in Goose Bay, Labrador. 
This system consists of a phased array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a
total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts.  See the paper
for more details.  The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere.
&quot;Good&quot; radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure 
in the ionosphere.  &quot;Bad&quot; returns are those that do not; their signals pass
through the ionosphere.  
</p>
<p>Received signals were processed using an autocorrelation function whose
arguments are the time of a pulse and the pulse number.  There were 17
pulse numbers for the Goose Bay system.  Instances in this database are
described by 2 attributes per pulse number, corresponding to the complex
values returned by the function resulting from the complex electromagnetic
signal.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(ionosphere)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 351 observations on the following 35 variables.
The first 34 continuous covariables are used for the prediction.
The 35th attribute is either <code>g</code> (&quot;good&quot;) or <code>b</code> (&quot;bad&quot;) 
according to the definition summarized above. This is a binary 
classification task.
