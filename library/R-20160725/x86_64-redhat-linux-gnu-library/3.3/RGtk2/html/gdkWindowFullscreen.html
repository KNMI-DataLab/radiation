<h2>gdkWindowFullscreen</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Moves the window into fullscreen mode. This means the
window covers the entire screen and is above any panels
or task bars.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>gdkWindowFullscreen(object)</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code><code style="white-space: pre;">object</code></code></td>
<td>
<p>a toplevel <code><a href="gdk-Windows.html">GdkWindow</a></code></p>
</td></tr></table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If the window was already fullscreen, then this function does nothing.
</p>
<p>On X11, asks the window manager to put <code>window</code> in a fullscreen
state, if the window manager supports this operation. Not all
window managers support this, and some deliberately ignore it or
don't have a concept of &quot;fullscreen&quot;; so you can't rely on the
fullscreenification actually happening. But it will happen with
most standard window managers, and GDK makes a best effort to get
it to happen.
Since 2.2</p>
