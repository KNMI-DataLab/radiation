<h2>gSocketSetKeepalive</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sets or unsets the <code>SO_KEEPALIVE</code> flag on the underlying socket. When
this flag is set on a socket, the system will attempt to verify that the
remote socket endpoint is still present if a sufficiently long period of
time passes with no data being exchanged. If the system is unable to
verify the presence of the remote endpoint, it will automatically close
the connection.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>gSocketSetKeepalive(object, keepalive)</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code><code style="white-space: pre;">object</code></code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code><a href="GSocket.html">GSocket</a></code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code><code style="white-space: pre;">keepalive</code></code></td>
<td>
<p>Value for the keepalive flag</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This option is only functional on certain kinds of sockets. (Notably,
<code>G_SOCKET_PROTOCOL_TCP</code> sockets.)
</p>
<p>The exact time between pings is system- and protocol-dependent, but will
normally be at least two hours. Most commonly, you would set this flag
on a server socket if you want to allow clients to remain idle for long
periods of time, but also want to ensure that connections are eventually
garbage-collected if clients crash or become unreachable.
Since 2.22</p>
