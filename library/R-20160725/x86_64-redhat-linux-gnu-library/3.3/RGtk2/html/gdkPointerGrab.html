<h2>gdkPointerGrab</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Grabs the pointer (usually a mouse) so that all events are passed to this
application until the pointer is ungrabbed with <code><a href="gdkPointerUngrab.html">gdkPointerUngrab</a></code>, or
the grab window becomes unviewable.
This overrides any previous pointer grab by this client.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>gdkPointerGrab(window, owner.events = FALSE, event.mask = 0, 
    confine.to = NULL, cursor = NULL, time = "GDK_CURRENT_TIME")</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code><code style="white-space: pre;">window</code></code></td>
<td>
<p>the <code><a href="gdk-Windows.html">GdkWindow</a></code> which will own the grab (the grab window).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code><code style="white-space: pre;">owner.events</code></code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>FALSE</code> then all pointer events are reported with respect to
<code>window</code> and are only reported if selected by <code>event.mask</code>. If <code>TRUE</code> then pointer
events for this application are reported as normal, but pointer events outside
this application are reported with respect to <code>window</code> and only if selected by
<code>event.mask</code>. In either mode, unreported events are discarded.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code><code style="white-space: pre;">event.mask</code></code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the event mask, which is used in accordance with
<code>owner.events</code>. Note that only pointer events (i.e. button and motion events)
may be selected.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code><code style="white-space: pre;">confine.to</code></code></td>
<td>
<p>If non-<code>NULL</code>, the pointer will be confined to this
window during the grab. If the pointer is outside <code>confine.to</code>, it will
automatically be moved to the closest edge of <code>confine.to</code> and enter
and leave events will be generated as necessary.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code><code style="white-space: pre;">cursor</code></code></td>
<td>
<p>the cursor to display while the grab is active. If this is <code>NULL</code> then
the normal cursors are used for <code>window</code> and its descendants, and the cursor
for <code>window</code> is used for all other windows.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code><code style="white-space: pre;">time</code></code></td>
<td>
<p>the timestamp of the event which led to this pointer grab. This usually
comes from a <code><a href="gdk-Event-Structures.html">GdkEventButton</a></code> struct, though <code>GDK_CURRENT_TIME</code> can be used if
the time isn't known.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Pointer grabs are used for operations which need complete control over mouse
events, even if the mouse leaves the application.
For example in GTK+ it is used for Drag and Drop, for dragging the handle in
the <code><a href="GtkHPaned.html">GtkHPaned</a></code> and <code><a href="GtkVPaned.html">GtkVPaned</a></code> widgets, and for resizing columns in <code><a href="GtkCList.html">GtkCList</a></code>
widgets.
</p>
<p>Note that if the event mask of an X window has selected both button press and
button release events, then a button press event will cause an automatic
pointer grab until the button is released.
X does this automatically since most applications expect to receive button
press and release events in pairs.
It is equivalent to a pointer grab on the window with <code>owner.events</code> set to
<code>TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>If you set up anything at the time you take the grab that needs to be cleaned
up when the grab ends, you should handle the <code><a href="gdk-Event-Structures.html">GdkEventGrabBroken</a></code> events that
are emitted when the grab ends unvoluntarily.</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>[<code><a href="gdk-General.html">GdkGrabStatus</a></code>] <code>GDK_GRAB_SUCCESS</code> if the grab was successful.</p>
