<h2>pangoLanguageGetDefault</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns the <code><a href="pango-Scripts-and-Languages.html">PangoLanguage</a></code> for the current locale of the process.
Note that this can change over the life of an application.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>pangoLanguageGetDefault()</pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>On Unix systems, this is the return value is derived from
<code>setlocale(LC_CTYPE, NULL)</code>, and the user can
affect this through the environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE or
LANG (checked in that order). The locale string typically is in
the form lang_COUNTRY, where lang is an ISO-639 language code, and
COUNTRY is an ISO-3166 country code. For instance, sv_FI for
Swedish as written in Finland or pt_BR for Portuguese as written in
Brazil.
</p>
<p>On Windows, the C library does not use any such environment
variables, and setting them won't affect the behavior of functions
like <code>ctime()</code>. The user sets the locale through the Regional Options
in the Control Panel. The C library (in the <code>setlocale()</code> function)
does not use country and language codes, but country and language
names spelled out in English.
However, this function does check the above environment
variables, and does return a Unix-style locale string based on
either said environment variables or the thread's current locale.
</p>
<p>Your application should call <code>setlocale(LC_ALL, "");</code>
for the user settings to take effect.  Gtk+ does this in its initialization
functions automatically (by calling <code>gtkSetLocale()</code>).
See <code>man setlocale</code> for more details.  
Since 1.16</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>[<code><a href="pango-Scripts-and-Languages.html">PangoLanguage</a></code>]  the default language as a <code><a href="pango-Scripts-and-Languages.html">PangoLanguage</a></code>, must not be
freed.</p>
