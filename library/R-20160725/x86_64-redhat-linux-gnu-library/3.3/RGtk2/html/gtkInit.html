<h2>gtkInit</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Call this function before using any other GTK+ functions in your GUI
applications.  It will initialize everything needed to operate the
toolkit and parses some standard command line options. <code>argc</code> and 
<code>argv</code> are adjusted accordingly so your own code will 
never see those standard arguments. </p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>gtkInit(args = "R")</pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that there are some alternative ways to initialize GTK+: 
if you are calling <code>gtkParseArgs()</code>, <code>gtkInitCheck()</code>, 
<code>gtkInitWithArgs()</code> or <code>gOptionContextParse()</code> with 
the option group returned by <code>gtkGetOptionGroup()</code>, you 
<em>don't</em> have to call <code><a href="gtkInit.html">gtkInit</a></code>.
<strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> This function will terminate your program if it was unable to initialize 
the GUI for some reason. If you want your program to fall back to a 
textual interface you want to call <code>gtkInitCheck()</code> instead.  <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Since 2.18, GTK+ calls <code>signal (SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)</code>
during initialization, to ignore SIGPIPE signals, since these are
almost never wanted in graphical applications. If you do need to
handle SIGPIPE for some reason, reset the handler after <code><a href="gtkInit.html">gtkInit</a></code>,
but notice that other libraries (e.g. libdbus or gvfs) might do
similar things.  </p>
